**************************************
	
*General*:	Data is organised as: Samples as rows, factors and scent compounds (VOCs) as columns.	
		The first row gives scent compound names as used in the publication, the third row uses names suitable for reading into R.  Skip the first two lines when reading data into R.	
		
*Code identification*:
ID		individual ID for each Arum maculatum plant individual	
area		region in which samples where collected: either N (north of the Alps) or S (south of the Alps).	
popul		population in which samples where collected: N: JOS (Austria), BUR, HOH, MUR, NEC (all Germany), RUM (Switzerland); S: DAO, LIM, MAH, MON, UDI (all Italy). For localities see original publication Gfrerer et al. 2021	
year		samples were collected between 2017-2019	
fruits		0/1 if fruits (infructescence) were found (1) or not found (0)	
fRS_proport	fruit set in [%], calculated as: (number of fruits/number of all female flowers)*100	
fRS_relative	relative fruit set as female fitness measurement for selection analyses, calculated only for JOS and DAO (two most extensively sampled populations) by: number of fruits per individual/ mean number of fruits in population	
totalScent	total (sum) absolute emission of scent per inflorescence in [ng per inflorescence per 5 min]	
totalCmpds	number of different individual scent compounds (VOCs) as detected and included in the analyses (occurs across all samples at least 3x) per individual	
KRI		Kovàts' retention index	
VOC		volatile organic compound	
		
*sheets*	
Data_scent_analysis	Data are quantitative scent data in [ng per inflorescence per 5 min]. For relative data standardise by total per individual (row).	
Data_JOS_selection	Reduced data set: includes only samples of population JOS and only scent compounds that occured at least in 50% of the samples as calculated by the simulation study. Data of individual VOCs are z-transformed (mean = 0, sd =1).	
Data_DAO_selection	Reduced data set: includes only samples of population DAO and only scent compounds that occured at least in 50% of the samples as calculated by the simulation study. Data of individual VOCs are z-transformed (mean = 0, sd =1).
